# CLINK-on-FPGA
Compact LSTM inference kernel implementation based on Vivado HLS on FPGA.

## Description

The compact LSTM kernel is a one-hidden-layer 5-node LSTM newwork.

It is designed to perform IIR filter approximation for the EEG signal processing.

However, the idea and implementation can be extended for a variety of embedded real-time applications.

The C simulation is based on the test bench of EEG sampling sequence, and the RTL/verilog kernel for FPGA implementation can be generated by the HLS c code by using the Vivado HLS tool.
