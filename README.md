# CLINK-on-FPGA
Compact LSTM inference kernel implementation based on Vivado HLS on FPGA.

## Brief Description

The compact LSTM kernel is a one-hidden-layer 5-node LSTM network.

It is designed to perform IIR filter approximation without acausal delay for the EEG signal processing.

However, the idea and implementation can be extended for a variety of embedded real-time applications.

The C simulation is based on the test bench of EEG sampling sequence, and the RTL/verilog kernel for FPGA implementation generated by the Vivado HLS has been verified to perform the same function.

Both the C and the FPGA implementation of the LSTM kernel is in 16-bit fixed point.

The FPGA implementation of the kernel is time multiplexed by 16 slices, so that it can be shared among 16 input channels.
